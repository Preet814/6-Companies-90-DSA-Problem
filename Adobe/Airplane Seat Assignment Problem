Problem : n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. 
          But after that, the rest of the passengers will:
          Take their own seat if it is still available, and
          Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied
          Return the probability that the nth person gets his own seat.
          
          Example 1:
          Input: n = 1
          Output: 1.00000
          Explanation: The first person can only get the first seat.
          Example 2:
          Input: n = 2
          Output: 0.50000
          Explanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the 
          first seat).

Solution : 

class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        // if toh n==1 than 1 person have to get 1 seat only 
        // but if let suppose n seats with n passenger then 1st person can have 2 option : 
        // one if he sit on his own seat and other if he sit on others seat because only 1st
        // person lost his ticket, further on we can say that nth person has also 2 option 
        // that if 1st person took his seat than nth person has to sit on others seat or else 
        // he can sit on his own seat so we can say that nth person has 2 choice so probability 
        // would be 1/2 every time for nth person except if n==1.
        if(n==1)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0.5;
    }
};
